This is a collection of little projects I've worked that use [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org). I haven't looked at this stuff in a long time, but I wanted it to be safe in case I needed it.

- For these pong games, `w` and `s` control the left paddle.
    - **AIPong**: An AI controls the paddle on the right.
    - **HumanPong**: The up and down arrow keys control the right paddle.
    - **SinglePong**: `w` and `s` also control the right paddle.
    - **BoringPong**: HumanPong, but the paddles can't go through the floor or ceiling.


- **AIMaze**: An AI randomly wanders in a maze.
- **MazeGame**: Use `wasd` to move around a maze.
- **MazeEditor**: Create/edit a maze.

- **Alleyway**: Press space to launch the ball, and use `a` and `d` or the left and right arrow keys to move the paddle.
- **FreeFall**: Press `r` to launch the ball.
- **Galaga**: Press space to shoot missile and click the left mouse button for a big laser.
- **Snake**: Don't worry, the snake can't die.

- **LinesIntersect**: Ever wnodered if two line segments were intersecting?
